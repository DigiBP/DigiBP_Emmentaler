## Process AS-IS Description

The process contains three roles: A requester, an innovation manager and the members of the company.

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Requester | Person who can raise the new proposal and is necessarily part of the company.
| Innovation Manager | Person who is responsible for reviewing of the new proposal.
| Members | Members of the company who can make use of right to veto.


It was decided to model a process of a company of one of our team members. The process is about requesting new proposals inside the company. It is not about proposals for external customers. The new proposals can be about changing the business guidelines, innovation, general improvements or future events.

The current process to request proposals is done in the chat application Telegram. There is no overview of the ongoing proposals, no possibility for improvement suggestions by other members of the company and discussions are hard to follow.

The process starts with the requester creating a proposal. The Chief of innovation then reviews the proposal. If the proposal is not complete, it is handed back to requester. If the proposal is complete, then it has to be decided if a pitch or a presentaiton of the proposal is necessary. This can help to get a better understanding of the request or the idea. If not, the 10 days right to veto starts. During this period, two tasks start: 
- Improvements to the proposal could be suggested by other members of the company. The improvements can be accepted by requester and implemented into the description. If the improvements are rejected by the requester, nothing changes.
- Member of team could making use of its right to veto. If the use of right to veto is made by at least one member of team, the proposal is declined and the process ends. 

If the use of right to veto is not made by any memeber of the team within the ten day period, the proposal is accepted and the process ends.
