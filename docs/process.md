## Scenario and User Experience (UX)

### Project Use Case

The company structure of Schaltstelle (schaltstelle.ch) allows each member of the company to have the same power of co-decision. No management rules over the company. If decisions have to be made, the members decide according to the principle of consent. The principle of consent means, as long as no member disapproves, the voting at hand is accepted. 

If a topic needs to be put to the vote, the related member has to explain it to the others, so that they can veto against it, if they disapprove. If any member disapproves, the proposal is declined. It is not a majority decision where the outcome is defined in what most members vote. 

Votings of proposals and their discussion and improvement suggestions are currently set up as a Telegram chatroom. The structure of a chatroom complicates the tracking of the status of proposals and their outcomes.

## Process Modelling


The process contains three roles: A requester, an innovation manager and the remaining members of the company.

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Requester | Person who can raise the new proposal and is necessarily a member of the company. |
| Innovation Manager | Person who is responsible for reviewing the new proposal. He makes suggestions to refine the proposal before it is up for voting. |
| Members | Members of the company who can make use of the right to veto. Any member has the possibility to propose requests. |


 Proposals that are up for voting can be classified amongst the following categories: 
 * Change of business guidelines (code of conduct, code of ethics)
 * Innovation (new business ideas or projects)
 * General improvements (office, infrastructure, technologies)
 * Future events (regulars' table, networking events, team events)
 * Marketing (social media, website, sponsoring)

The current process to request proposals is done in the chat application Telegram. There is no overview of the ongoing proposals, no possibility for improvement suggestions by other members of the company and discussions are hard to follow.


### Process AS-IS Description


The process starts with the requester creating a proposal. It must be phrased to allow a yes / no decision. The Chief of innovation reviews the proposal. If the proposal is not complete, it is handed back to the requester. If the Chief of innovation declares the proposal as complete, the proposal is ready for voting. Next, the members need to decide if they want a pitch or presentation of the proposal to learn about its details. This can help to get a better understanding of the request or the idea. If not, the 10 days right to veto starts for all the members. During this period, two tasks commence: 
- Members of the company could suggest improvements to the proposal. The improvements can be accepted by the requester and implemented into the description. If the requestor rejects the improvements, nothing changes.
- Members of the company can make use of their right to veto. If at least one member makes the use of the right to veto, the proposal is declined, and the process ends. If the members do not make their use of the right to veto within the ten days, the proposal is accepted, and the process ends.
