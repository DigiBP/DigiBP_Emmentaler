# Process Documentation

## 1. Project Scope
The scope of the project is to investigate how the digitalisation affects business processes in an enterprise, how an ideal interaction of natural and artificial intelligence in an organisational environment can be achieved, and how cooperation and partnership among humans and technology can result in adequate business process execution. This investigation will be realised by application, implementation and demonstration of real prototypical instantiations.

## 3. Use Case Identification
The team has worked together in a brainstorming phase on identification of use case they would like to work on. It was decided to model a process owned by company of one of the team members. The process presents the procedure for the new proposals with respect to changing the business guidlines, innovation, general improvements or future events inside the company. It has to be pointed out that the process does not relate to external clients.

## 4. Process AS-IS Description

The process contains three roles: A requester, an innovation manager and the members of the company.

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Requester | Person who can raise the new proposal and is necessarily part of the company. |
| Innovation Manager | Person who is responsible for reviewing of the new proposal. |
| Members | Members of the company who can make use of right to veto. |

The current process to request proposals is done in the chat application Telegram. There is no overview of the ongoing proposals, no possibility for improvement suggestions by other members of the company and discussions are hard to follow.

The process starts with the requester creating a proposal. The Chief of Innovation then reviews the proposal. If the proposal is not complete, it is handed back to requester. If the proposal is complete, then it has to be decided if a pitch or a presentaiton of the proposal is necessary. This can help to get a better understanding of the request or the idea. If not, the 10 days right to veto starts. During this period, two tasks start: 
- Improvements to the proposal could be suggested by other members of the company. The improvements can be accepted by requester and implemented into the description. If the improvements are rejected by the requester, nothing changes.
- Member of team could making use of its right to veto. If the use of right to veto is made by at least one member of team, the proposal is declined and the process ends. 

If the use of right to veto is not made by any member of the team within the ten day period, the proposal is accepted and the process ends.
